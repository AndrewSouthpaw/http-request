## TODO list

 * Test 4xx errors with compressed response
 * Test 4xx errors against overflowing response document
 * Test 304 handling (implement it first)
 * Test the error handling for a bad callback (main.head, main.get)
 * Test the proxy implementation
 * Make sure the options list of http-get is properly implemented
 * Remove the *nix dependency in request-stream (use a cross platform implementation for the source of createReadStream)
